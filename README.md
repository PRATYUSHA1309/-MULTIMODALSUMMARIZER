# -MULTIMODALSUMMARIZER
 MULTIMODALSUMMARIZER–TEXT AND YOUTUBE SUMMARIZATION USING HUGGINGFACE AND GRADIO
 • Developed an interactive GenAI-powered application to summarize both YouTube videos and raw text content, showcasing
 real-world utility of multimodal summarization.
 • Used YouTube Transcript API to extract video captions and applied pre-trained transformer models (t5-small, bart, for abstractive
 summarization.
 • Built a Gradio-based UI enabling users to input URLs, text, documents and receive human-like summaries instantly and download
 the summarized output as a file.
 • Demonstrated strong understanding of transformer pipelines, tokenization, and LLM inference workflows with real-time
 processing
