# MULTIMODAL SUMMARIZER
 ## TEXT AND YOUTUBE SUMMARIZATION USING HUGGINGFACE AND GRADIO
 #### • Developed an interactive GenAI-powered application to summarize both YouTube videos and raw text content, showcasing real-world utility of multimodal summarization.
 
 #### • Used YouTube Transcript API to extract video captions and applied pre-trained transformer models (t5-small, bart, for abstractive summarization.
 #### • Built a Gradio-based UI enabling users to input URLs, text, documents and receive human-like summaries instantly and download the summarized output as a file.
 #### • Demonstrated strong understanding of transformer pipelines, tokenization, and LLM inference workflows with real-time processing
